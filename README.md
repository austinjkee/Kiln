# OpenKiln
An object-oriented 3D modelling framework.

## About this Project
**This project is not about implementation.**
Rather, it focuses on drafting a design for such a framework, consisting of developer thought process, UML diagrams, protocol whitepapers, and example pseudocode.
We'll leave the rest to the community.
